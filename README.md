# Hi there ğŸ‘‹. I'm Natalia.



## About me

My name is Natalia Venditto and I currently work in the role of Principal Program Manager with Microsoft, leading the *JavaScript* and *Node.js* e2e developer experience on Azure. 
Previously I was a Senior Solutions Architect with MongoDB and, even before that, a Principal Solutions Architect and Principal Frontend Engineer at Netcentric, a Cognizant Digital Business. I have been working professionally in web development since 2005 when I transitioned from Graphic Designer to Web Designer, and then Developer. (and non-professionally, a bunch of years before that)

If you wanna know more about me, please visit my personal website:

that I use to speak about full-stack JavaScript development, micro architectures, composability, serverless and cloud-native.
