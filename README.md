### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Happy you're here! Hopefully you find something really useful!

My name is Natalia Venditto and I currently work in the role of Principal Solutions Architect at Netcentric, a Cognizant Digital Business.

I am also a Google Developer Expert for Angular and Web Technologies, an Auth0 Ambassador, and a Women Techmaker IWD Organizer.

I love sharing my learnings of 20+ years in the Design and Sofware Development industries, combined, with the community, so I regularly participate of International Conferences, train developers at workshops, and spread knowledge via blog posts in communities like https://dev.to/anfibiacreativa and https://indepth.dev/authors/1089/natalia

Here  you will find some of the conferences I've participated of, in the past 2 years:
