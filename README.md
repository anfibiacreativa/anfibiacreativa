## About me

My name is Natalia Venditto and I currently work in the role of Principal Program Manager with Microsoft, leading the *JavaScript* and *Node.js* e2e experience on Azure. 
Previously I was a Senior Solutions Architect with MongoDB and, even before that, a Principal Solutions Architect and Principal Frontend Engineer at Netcentric, a Cognizant Digital Business. I have been working in web development since 2005 when I transitioned from Graphic Designer to Web Designer, and then Developer.
