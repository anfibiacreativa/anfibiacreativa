### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Happy you're here! Hopefully you find something really useful!

## About me

My name is Natalia Venditto and I currently work in the role of Principal Program Manager with Microsoft, leading the *JavaScript* and *NodeJS* e2e experience on Azure. 
Previously I was a Senior Solutions Architect with MongoDB and, even before that, a Principal Solutions Architect at Netcentric, a Cognizant Digital Business. I have been working in web development since 2005 when I transitioned from Graphic Designer to Web Designer, and then Developer. 

I am also a Google Developer Expert for Angular and Web Technologies, an Auth0 Ambassador, and a Women Techmakers IWD Organizer, for the Barcelona Chapter. In August 2021 I got a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional Award for Developer Technologies.

Because I am self-taught, I am very passionate about sharing what I know with the community, so I regularly participate of International Conferences, train and mentor developers individually and collectivelly at workshops, and spread knowledge via blog posts in communities like https://dev.to/anfibiacreativa and https://indepth.dev/authors/1089/natalia

I also work hard to raise awareness of the gender gap in technology related jobs.

Here  you will find some of the conferences I've participated of, in the past 2 years:
